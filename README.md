# KBC (Kon Banega Crorepati) Python Game üéÆ

Welcome to **KBC Kon Banega Crorepati**, a Python-based game inspired by the popular Indian quiz show! This project is a fun and engaging general knowledge quiz with a twist of risk and reward. Test your knowledge while managing the thrill of penalties and milestones. 

## Features ‚ú®

1. **Random Question Selection**:
   - The game randomly selects 12 questions from a larger pool of general knowledge questions. 
   - Questions cover a variety of topics, such as geography, history, science, and pop culture.

2. **Progressive Rewards**:
   - Earn progressively higher rewards as you answer questions correctly.
   - Milestones at every 3rd question ensure guaranteed winnings when crossed.

3. **Penalty for Quitting Early**:
   - Adds a strategic layer: the earlier you quit, the higher the penalty.
   - Encourages players to weigh their risks and play strategically.

4. **Custom Error Handling**:
   - Handles incorrect user inputs with a custom error message, ensuring a smooth gaming experience.

5. **Interactive Gameplay**:
   - Each question includes four multiple-choice options.
   - Players can choose to answer or quit the game at any point.

## How It Works üîß

1. **Question Module**:
   - The `kbc_questions` module provides a list of general knowledge questions.
   - The `get_questions()` function randomly selects 12 questions for each game session.

2. **Main Game Logic**:
   - The game iterates through the 12 questions and checks the player's answers.
   - Rewards are updated after every 3rd correct answer:
     - Questions 1-3: $1000, $2000, $5000
     - Questions 4-6: $10,000, $25,000, $50,000
     - Questions 7-9: $100,000, $150,000, $200,000
     - Questions 10-12: $250,000, $500,000, $1,000,000
   - Milestones ensure guaranteed winnings if reached.
   - Players who quit early face penalties based on their progress.

3. **Custom Exceptions**:
   - Handles invalid inputs (e.g., selecting options outside 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', or quitting with '0') with user-friendly error messages.

4. **Endgame**:
   - Displays the total winnings based on the player's progress, penalties, and milestones.
